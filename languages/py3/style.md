# Elements of Style
> Constrained Python3 solutions to a problem. <br>
> Based on [Exercises in Programming Style](https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style) by [Cristina Lopez](http://tagide.com/about.html). <br>

# The Problem

Given a text file, produce a list of words with their frequencies, printing 'N' of them out in a decreasing order of frequency. <br>
Make sure to "lowercase" everything, and ignore stopwords (the, for, in, ...) <br>

# Index

- [01](#01)

## 01

__Constraints__ <br>

- Fixed primary memory-size (eg. 1024 memory-blocks)
- No identifiers - no variables or tagged memory addresses. Memory can be accessed only through each of these numbered locations.
