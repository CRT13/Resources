## Ideas

- Wikipedia LookUp <br>
    Look up articles on wikipedia. Get summary, Import As `Text` or `MP3`.
    Ideal for getting first impressions on topics of interest.
    All records `Text`, `MP3` can be searched (for existence), and queried (if they exist).
    If multiple MP3s are exported into a MD file, a note-taking experience can be created, where user can listen to audio, and add notes. Like `Lyrics.md`.

- Wikipedia GeoSearch <br>
    Search by location co-ordinates. Display summary, images, and fulltext (optimized for what the info is being used for).
